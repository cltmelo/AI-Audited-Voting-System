Analyze the following voting data. Each record contains:
- 'voter': The voter's wallet address.
- 'txCount': The "age" of the wallet (transaction count).
- 'balance': The ETH balance at the time of voting.
- 'txHash': The transaction hash.

TASK:
**Generate an audit report in Brazilian Portuguese (Português-BR).**
Focus on identifying:
1.  **Sybil Attacks:** Look for a large number of votes
    coming from very new wallets (e.g., low 'txCount' like 1, 2, or 3).
    This suggests a single actor created multiple wallets to vote.
2.  **General Anomalies:** Any other pattern that seems suspicious (e.g., multiple
    votes with identical or very low balances).

Provide a clear executive summary and, if applicable, a list
of suspicious wallet addresses, explaining why.
